# SOFA-SPIDER

In this project, a strain sensor inspired by spider orb web is simulated in SOFA physics engine simulator which is based on finite element method. The sensor "spider web" is made from conductive materials "Ninjatek EEL" with Young's Modulus 9e6 Pa and the matrix is DragonSkin30 with Young's Modulus 0.6e6 Pa. In this uni-axial tensile test physics simulation, the local strains of the sensor at both radials and spirals segements can be calculated using SOFA python script controller
